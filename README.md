Abstract     :-

              Mentoring  is  a  conventional  method  of transferring knowledge and ideas from confirmed  professional
  in  an  society  to  an  inexperienced member  in  the  sector.  Education  sector  has  found mentoring as quite
  effective tool since long back and with the advent of new technologies, comes an idea of online  mentoring,  which  
  is  also  referred  to  as  e-mentoring.  Instead of  face-to-face  meetings,  Online Mentoring  System  (OMS)  uses  
  asynchronous ,electronic  communications to  establish  and support the relationship between mentor and the student 
  using virtual  mode.  E-Mentoring  uses  computerized medium to transfer knowledge and skills from teacher to student. 
  It basically focuses on student and faculty relationship.  Online  Mentoring  System  is  a  Client Server  model,  
  which  acts  as  an  Interface  between Teacher and Student. OMS strives to reduce the work load of students  
  in entering  their details  and at the same time enable the Mentors to assess their students more  efficiently.  
  E-Mentoring  is  fundamentally developed to improve the performance of students by assisting  mentors  to  
  understand  the  problems  of students  more  effectively  and  easily.  In  order  to achieve this, 
  a review system  is also  included.

INTRODUCTION :-
 
             To  Development  and  securing  of  excellence  human resources under both the internal and external
  environmental changes are  a key  deciding factor  of the national competitiveness.  However,  due  to  the  
  poor  vocational  training    or career guidance services in college. The colleges have not  been  playing  
  its  role  in  the  transition  to  the  professional  world  for  their  students,  who consequently cannot 
  meet  the demand from industry. Currently,  most  of  colleges  provide  students  with relevant  information and
  vocational  guidance  via systems  such  as  an  on/off-line  career    information office  or  consultation  center,
  and  an  internship. However,  since  a  systematic  connection  between individual students is  not made, its effect 
  is utterly  limited.  Vocational  training  or  career  guidance service  in  the  college  is  poor,  And  thus  colleges  
  cannot play its right  role in  the transition  of college students  to the  professionals  stage after  graduation. 
  Therefore,  it  is  considered  that  college  graduates generally cannot meets the demand from Industry.
